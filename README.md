# üöÄ **Applied Data Science Capstone - SpaceX Landing Prediction**

## üìå **Project Overview**  
This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** specialization. It focuses on using **data science and machine learning** to predict **the success of SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 first-stage landings**. The goal is to analyze various launch factors and develop predictive models to determine if SpaceX can **reuse the first stage**, which significantly reduces launch costs.

In the extended version of the project, we converted the ML solution into a production-grade pipeline with automated training, experiment tracking, model registry, and cloud deployment. While we initially deployed the model to **GCP Vertex AI**, we later moved to **Cloud Run** for cost-efficiency.

## üìä **Key Questions Addressed**  
1. How do variables such as **payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits** affect the success of the first-stage landing?  
2. Has the **rate of successful landings increased over the years**?  
3. What is the **best machine learning algorithm** for predicting success in this scenario?

## üèõ **Methodology**  
### üîπ **1. Data Collection**  
- **SpaceX REST API** was used to collect launch data.  
- **Web scraping** from Wikipedia was implemented to gather additional details.  

### üîπ **2. Data Wrangling & Preprocessing**  
- Filtering relevant columns.  
- Handling missing values.  
- Applying **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical variables.  

### üîπ **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Dash**.  
- **SQL queries** were used to analyze structured launch data.  

### üîπ **4. Interactive Visual Analytics**  
- **Folium** was used for geospatial analysis of launch sites.  
- **Dash application** was built to create interactive visualizations.  

### üîπ **5. Machine Learning Prediction**  
- **Supervised classification models** were trained to predict **successful landings**.  
- **Algorithms used**:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

### üîπ **6. MLOps and Productionization**  
- ML model training pipeline was automated using **Airflow DAG**.  
- Model experiments were tracked with **MLflow**, with metrics, params, and model versioning.  
- CI/CD using **GitHub Actions** retrains and logs models automatically on commit.  
- The top-performing model was containerized using **Docker** and served with **FastAPI**.  
- Deployed to **GCP Cloud Run** via container image in **Artifact Registry**.  
- **Note:** Deployment to **Vertex AI** was attempted and functional, but later discontinued due to billing constraints.
